# Human DPIN (Decentralized Personal Intelligent Number)

Human DPIN is the world’s first on-chain scoring system that recognizes and rewards the intangible human values individuals carry — wisdom, knowledge, and life energy.

Using a hybrid **DAO + AI** model, short, consented audio “value moments” are analyzed and validated to produce a **DPIN score** between 0 and 9, stored permanently on-chain. This score becomes your digital proof of human value and can unlock rewards, reputation, and marketplace opportunities.

## How It Works
1. **Capture** – Users record short, intentional voice clips (wisdom, advice, problem-solving).
2. **AI Analysis (45%)** – AI evaluates the clip for knowledge depth, clarity, emotional resonance, and cultural relevance.
3. **DAO Validation (55%)** – Verified community members review and vote on the clip’s value, ensuring fairness and preventing manipulation.
4. **Scoring** – Final DPIN score calculated from both AI and DAO results, weighted DAO 55% / AI 45%.
5. **On-Chain Storage** – Scores are stored publicly for transparency.
6. **Rewards & Marketplace** – Clips and wisdom moments can be licensed, sold, or archived in the Bridge Marketplace.

## Why It Matters
- **Protects human rights** by giving unheard voices a measurable value.
- **Elevates wisdom** over clout in the digital economy.
- **Enables discovery** of valuable minds anywhere in the world.

## Tokenomics
Powered by **CycleLock Tokenomics™**:
- Early backers fund the smart pool.
- Tokens auto-lock and release gradually to protect long-term value.
- Rewards shared fairly between backers, contributors, and the DAO.
